# Synthetic Stream Gauges Using Leaky Bucket Model and LSTM Networks

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook and associated code for the paper titled "Synthetic Stream Gauges: An LSTM-Based Approach to Enhance River Streamflow Predictions in Unmonitored Segments (Under Review)", which describes the development and application of a synthetic stream gauge model using the Leaky Bucket concept combined with LSTM networks for analyzing synthetic data generated by this model.

## Overview

The notebook illustrates the process of creating the Leaky Bucket model and the basin networks to produce synthetic data, as well as employing an LSTM model to separate the combined downstream flow of simulated main rivers into the individual upstream flows of its tributaries.

## Main Sections

1. **Setup:** Initial setup and library imports.
2. **Deep Learning Model:** Definition and training of the neural network model.
3. **Final Model Evaluation:** Evaluation of the model performance.

## Libraries Used

The code utilizes several libraries, including:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn
- PyTorch
- TQDM
- IPython

## Getting Started

To run this notebook, please ensure you have installed all required libraries. A recommended approach is to create a virtual environment and install the dependencies via `pip`:

```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn torch tqdm ipython
```
